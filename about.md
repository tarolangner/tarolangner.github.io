---


Taro Langner is a Machine Learning Scientist at [Versiro](https://www.versiro.com/), a Norwegian startup 
working on predictability for electricity markets in transition to green energy.

His PhD background and experience in the medical industry with clinical trials 
includes applied deep learning research for computer vision on radiology data. 
He published [several deep learning papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=18mXNRsAAAAJ&hl=de) as first author, co-authored a book on machine learning for MRI and contributed 40,000 deep-learning-based kidney measurements to the [official UK Biobank data catalogue](https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/label.cgi?id=159).

He founded this blog as a passion project in his spare time because he likes the way *labbet* (from Swedish *tensorlabbet* -> 'The tensor lab') rolls of his tongue and required an outlet for his free expression of thoughts and opinions beyond anything peer review, quality control or good taste would normally allow.
